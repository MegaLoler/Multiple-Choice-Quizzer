# Multiple Choice Quizzer

Just a simple script to give you a multiple choice quiz on the command line!

To use, just run the script with the quiz file as the first argument.

The quiz file format is such that each question is separated by a blank line, the first line of each block is the question, and the following lines are the answers. The correct answers begin with an astrerisk. See `example_quiz.txt` for an example!
